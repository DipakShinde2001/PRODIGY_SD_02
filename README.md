Guess the Number Game A simple Java console application that challenges the user to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low and tracks the number of attempts until the correct guess is made.



### How it works:
1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.
2. The user is prompted to guess the number.
3. The program compares the user's guess to the generated number and provides feedback:
   - "Too low!" if the guess is less than the number.
   - "Too high!" if the guess is greater than the number.
4. The game continues until the user correctly guesses the number.
5. The program then displays the number of attempts the user made.

You can run this code in any Java environment, and it will provide an interactive guessing game.
